          q: "What is Sealia?",
          a: "Sealia is a secure platform that lets you create and verify digital agreements directly from WhatsApp â€” no extra apps or document editors required."
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need to download another app?",
          a: "No. Sealia works inside WhatsApp through an intelligent chatbot. You'll only need to sign up once at Sealia.app to manage your account and templates."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I get started with Sealia?",
          a: "Simply register for a free account, connect your WhatsApp, and you can start creating secure agreements immediately. Our setup process takes less than 2 minutes."

      category: "Security & Verification",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "Is Sealia legally binding?",
          a: "Yes. Each agreement includes verified identity data such as name, phone number, email, and timestamp, combined with optional biometric or password confirmation, creating a verifiable digital record."
        },
        {
          q: "How does Sealia verify signatures?",
          a: "When a client agrees, Sealia checks for one or more of the following: Fingerprint or Face ID confirmation (if device supports it), Password or PIN confirmation, Device and location verification. All this data is securely logged and linked to the agreement."
        },
        {
          q: "Can agreements be tampered with after signing?",
          a: "No. Once an agreement is signed, it becomes tamper-proof. Any attempt to modify the document will be detected and the verification will fail. Each document has a unique verification ID for authenticity checks."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I verify if a document is authentic?",
          a: "Every signed document gets a unique verification ID. Anyone can visit sealia.app/verify/[ID] to confirm the document's authenticity, see who signed it, when, and from where."
        }

    },
    {
      category: "WhatsApp Integration",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "How does the WhatsApp integration work?",
          a: "Sealia uses WhatsApp's official API to send agreement notifications and receive confirmations. You can create, send, and sign agreements without leaving your WhatsApp chat."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I use Sealia with my existing WhatsApp Business account?",
          a: "Yes! Sealia works seamlessly with both personal and business WhatsApp accounts. It's designed to integrate with your existing business communication workflow."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "Business Use",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "Can Sealia be used by small businesses or freelancers?",
          a: "Absolutely. Sealia was built for freelancers, photographers, designers, and small businesses that use WhatsApp to manage clients and need fast, trustworthy agreements."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I customize my contract templates?",
          a: "Yes. You can upload or create your own templates directly in your Sealia dashboard. Later, just type @/contract on WhatsApp to pull it into your chat."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens after an agreement is signed?",
          a: "A signed PDF copy is generated automatically and sent to both parties via WhatsApp and email. You can also download or verify it anytime from your dashboard."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "Data & Privacy",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "Is my data safe?",
          a: "Yes. All information is encrypted and stored using Supabase + Cloudflare R2 infrastructure, with access only through verified user accounts."
        },
        {
          q: "Which countries and regions do you support?",
          a: "Sealia is designed to work globally. We support agreements in over 50 countries and comply with local electronic signature laws including eIDAS (EU), ESIGN Act (US), and similar regulations worldwide."
        },
        {
          q: "How long are signed documents stored?",
          a: "All signed agreements are stored securely for a minimum of 7 years, meeting most legal requirements for document retention. You can download copies at any time."
